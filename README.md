# Design-of-a-Triangular-Patch-Antenna-with-Inset-Feed using CST
Design of a Triangular Patch Antenna with inset feed optimized for a specific frequency or frequency band 
Length of the patch antenna was calculated as a=42.54m
 Height of the patch cut was taken as h1 = 7.5
Length of ground, Lg= Length of substrate, Ls= 6*1.6 + a
 Width of ground, Wg= Width of substrate, Ws= 6*1.6+ a
 Feeder length was calculated as Lf= 16.760 mm and width , W0= 3.021 mm
